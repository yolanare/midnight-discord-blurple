# midnight-blurple

a darkened discord theme with rounded corners and using blurple as accent color.

forked from the [midnight-discord](https://github.com/refact0r/midnight-discord) theme because I wanted to add my own fixes and UI magic

| `animated context menu`<br>a quick animation so that it looks cool and also to not get in the way | <img width=360 src="./assets/midnight-blurple--context-menu-animation.gif" alt="midnight-blurple--context-menu-animation"><br>*Zoom level at 125%, colors are fudged because of the gif format* |
| `elevated system messages`<br>to differentiate them from the other messages | ![midnight-blurple--dm-call-message](./assets/midnight-blurple--dm-call-message.png)<br>*Zoom level at 125%* |
