# midnight-blurple

a darkened discord theme with rounded corners and using blurple as accent color.

forked from the [midnight-discord](https://github.com/refact0r/midnight-discord) theme because I wanted to add my own fixes and UI magic

## install

> make sure to enable dark mode in discord settings for the theme to apply properly! (if you want light mode customize the theme color variables)

#### betterdiscord (or client with local theme folder)

1. download `midnight-blurple.theme.css` from this repo.
2. put the file into your theme folder. (there should be a button to open the theme folder in theme settings)
3. (optional) customize the theme in `midnight-blurple.theme.css`.

#### install through link
